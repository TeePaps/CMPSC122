HOMEWORK 2 DUE: 
AFTER SPRING BREAK

myString = STLString.c_str()


TLD is subclass of subdomain
	Vector of subdomain part pointer
	Push_back()
	heap allocated 
	must have destructor to deallocate array


Load TLDs into vector
	do match against vector


Read about MAPS: Ch. 9.1, 9.2
	TLD-> 1
	Key->value
	map[TLD]
	map<string,bool>
	TldPart::ValidTlds;


Whenever you have static members, must be instantiated in cpp file.

New STATIC function preload in TLD to open and read file.
	Include if statement (ex. if !empty: do nothing)
